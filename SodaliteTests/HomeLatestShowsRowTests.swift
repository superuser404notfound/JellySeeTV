/// Jellyfin 12 answers `/Items/Latest` from two different implementations. With a `ParentId` on a
/// tvshows library it groups in SQL, one entry per series, and hands back a Season, a Series or a
/// bare Episode depending on what arrived. Without one it falls through to the old path, which
/// scans the newest `Limit * 2` items across every library and groups them in memory: one bulk
/// import is enough to fill that window, and the row collapses to the handful of series inside it.
///
/// So the row must never ask the untyped aggregate just because the library list has not landed
/// yet, and the entries it does get back must all end up as the series the row's title promises.
