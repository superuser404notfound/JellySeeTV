/// The diagnostic log, reached from a screen that has no Settings behind it.

/// Setup is where the log matters most and where it was the one place unreachable from. Before a
/// server is added there is no tab bar and no Settings at all, so the person who has to read the
/// lines, the one whose server will not connect, was the only one who could not get to them. The
/// same screen in add-mode is a full-screen cover over Settings, which is the other half of the
/// same gap (Discord report, 2026-08-30).
///
/// Placed only where a failure is already on screen. A log button next to a scan that is working
/// is noise, and the lines mean nothing to somebody who has no question yet.
