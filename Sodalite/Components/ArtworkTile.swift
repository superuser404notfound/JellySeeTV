/// left), so scrim, label and shape live here once instead of three times.
///
/// `fallback` paints both the loading state and the no-artwork state, so a caller can hand over a
/// plain gradient, or a gradient carrying a generic icon and a label of its own.

/// label readable, so without one it would only dim the artwork. Callers whose artwork tends to
/// carry its own name (library images usually do) pass nil and put the label in `fallback`, where
/// it shows exactly when there is no artwork to name the tile. Such a caller must drop its own
/// copy while passing a title, else both are drawn on the same spot in the no-artwork case.
